If on a physical keyboard, there's a gentle clack with each keystroke.","Typing involves rhythmic keystrokes, varied by keyboard material and typist speed; click-clack sounds from mechanical switches; soft thuds from membrane keys; spacebar thumps; occasional longer pauses; and intermittent space bar pressing. Background noise may rise from fast typing, while slow typing creates intermittent, discrete taps."
Uneven Bars,"Uneven Bars is a women's gymnastics apparatus featuring two horizontal bars set at different heights where gymnasts perform a choreographed routine of swings, transitions, releases, and catches, culminating in a dismount. Mastery demands strength, agility, coordination, and precise timing.","Uneven Bars is a gymnastics event featuring two horizontal bars set at different heights. Gymnasts perform aerial flips, swings, and transitions with precise timing and fluid motions, alternating between the bars in a display of agility, strength, and grace.","Rhythmic swinging, metallic clinks of hands grasping bars, thuds of dismounts onto the mat, occasional chalk dusting sounds, audience's applause, coaches' instructions, athletes' grunts of exertion, occasional tension release creaks from the apparatus, and the muffled background hum of a gymnasium's atmosphere."
Volleyball Spiking,"Volleyball spiking is an aggressive, overhead attacking move where a player jumps and forcefully hits the ball downward over the net into the opponent's court, aiming to evade defenders or make the ball difficult to return, often concluding a point-scoring opportunity with power and precision.","A volleyball spiker jumps high near the net, pulling back their arm with an open hand. The body is tensed and angled, eyes focused on the ball. They forcefully swing their arm forward, hand striking the ball sharply, sending it over the net with speed and precision toward the floor.","A volleyball spike is accompanied by the sharp, resonant sound of the palm striking the ball, followed by a thud as the ball hits the ground, often mixed with the anticipatory shouts of players and the cheering of spectators. Sound intensity increases with the force of the spike."
Walk Dog,"Walking a dog is a physical activity involving an owner taking their canine companion outdoors on a leash for exercise and bathroom breaks, frequently incorporating play, improving both the dog's and owner’s health, and strengthening their bond.","A person holding a leash attached to a dog's collar; the dog may be trotting or sniffing around.

Wall Pushups,"Wall pushups are a beginner-friendly exercise that serves as an easier alternative to traditional pushups. They target the chest, arms, and shoulders by using the resistance of one's own body weight against a wall, promoting upper body strength and endurance through pushing away and lowering towards a vertical surface.","An individual stands facing a wall, places palms flat against it at shoulder width, steps back to lean in, and bends elbows to lower their chest to the wall before pushing back to the starting position, replicating a pushup motion vertically.","Wall pushups may produce rhythmic tapping or slapping sounds as hands repeatedly contact and push off the wall, with varying intensity reflecting pushup force. Soft foot shuffling can accompany stance adjustments, and exhales might be audible with exertion, often synchronized with the push motion."
Writing On Board,"""Writing on board"" is an instructional activity where a facilitator or participant conveys information, solves problems, or teaches by inscribing words, numbers, or drawings on a surface, typically using markers or chalk, to visually communicate and engage an audience in a collaborative or educational setting.","A person stands facing a board, holding a marker or chalk, with hand movements indicating inscription. Words or drawings appear on the board's surface, often accompanied by erasing and revising as ideas are developed or explained.","Scraping or squeaking sounds of chalk or marker on the surface, tapping of the writing utensil, faint rustle of clothing as the writer reaches and moves, occasional erasing sounds—like brushing or swiping, soft clicking of pen caps or chalk pieces being picked up or set down."
YoYo,"YoYo is a classic toy consisting of a spool connected to a string, which is wound and unwound to perform gravity-defying tricks and maneuvers. It's both a hobby and competitive sport, with enthusiasts striving to master intricate techniques and create new combinations of spins and movements.","YoYo involves a player holding one end of a string with the other end attached to two symmetrical discs, through which the string runs. The player performs tricks by looping, tossing, and twirling the YoYo, which rolls up and down the string using its spinning momentum.","While playing with a yo-yo, one might hear the hum of the spinning string, the gentle whir of the yo-yo's rotations, intermittent soft thuds upon catching, and occasional snaps as the yo-yo changes direction or performs tricks. Sound intensity varies with speed and surface contact."
